# Getting Started with Create React App

This app is based of a 2020's video by Web Dev Simplified:

-OG git repository [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Whatsapp-Clone)

I updated some of the code to use react-router-dom v6 and up, and Firebase v9. As for the rest, it is practically identical to Kyle's version.
